# Firefighting robot

## Info
This Arduino script controls an autonomous robot that is capable of navigating a maze and putting out artificial fires. This was done with two other classmates who were responsible for the mechanical and electrical components. I handled all of the programming.

## Usage
This script is designed for general use (with the right equipment)! The code can be run in Arduino IDE and uploaded to a board; I used version 2.2.1 of Arduino IDE in the most recent iteration.

## Dependencies
This script depends a lot on physical mechanics. I have listed the parts within the current robot design.
* 1 Arduino RoMeo board
* 1 JuLiet board
* 1 9.6V 2000 mAh rechargeable battery pack
* 2 DC motors - AUTOTOOLHOME 6-12V 
* 1 Touch sensor
  * 47kΩ resistor
  * touch sensor switch (physical end stop)
  * stranded wires
  * crimps
  * 3-pin female connector
* 2 infrared proximity sensors - Sharp GP2Y0A21YK
  * 240Ω resistor
  * 10µF capacitor
* 1 stripe sensor with shroud
  * An emitter — LED
  * A receiver — a photocell
* 1 flame sensor
  * Phototransistor
  * 680Ω resistor
  * An emitter - LED
